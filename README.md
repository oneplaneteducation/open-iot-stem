	- Update Boards
    
    	*We are using an Wisblock nRF52 for this training session you will need to add third party board support*
        *Arduino has built in board support for many boards but if you use others see [third-party boards in](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Unofficial-list-of-3rd-party-boards-support-urls) they will be appended to this same location*
    
   		- Verify Arduino is open and use title menu to navigate to: **File>Prefernces>Additional Board Support**
      
    		- Paste the following into the location and click OK to accept

   		  	```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAKwireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index/main/package_rakwireless_index.json```
       
			```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAKwireless/RAKwireless-Arduino-BSP-Index/main/package_rakwireless_com_rui_index.json```
       

    		- Open board manager **Tools>Board>Boards Manager** or CTRL+SHIFT+B

## Edit code
*[5 min] In order for the IoT device to be recognized within the LoRaWAN network you will need to add secret keys to the code these are similar to a username and password*

- Edit code and to add LoRaWAN secrets and keys for the IoT

	- Navigate to the code window hold the CTRL key and press F to search the code

 	- Type 'deviceEUI' to locate the secrets that require updating
 
  	- Update the 00000s in the code to reflect the secrets for your IoT device

   	-  Save the sketch **File>Save** CTRL+S 
  
## Compile and build code
*[5 min] To run the code we need to verify the code for errors and check that all necessary libraries and components are installed this is referred as building and/or compiling*

- Click the Verify button to compile and build code 

  	![notext](https://github.com/GrayHatGuy/open-iot-stem/blob/ffa3bece4b30c3b41f0eb4d35138f64f3d5a86ac/img/compile.png)

- You will see the following if the code has succesffully been Verified

## Flash code
*After the code has completed a successful build/compile we need to upload the program and flash the iot device with the code*

- Verify USB is connected to IoT

- Check that correct board and port is selected

	![notext](https://github.com/GrayHatGuy/open-iot-stem/blob/ffa3bece4b30c3b41f0eb4d35138f64f3d5a86ac/img/port%20select.png)
  
- Select the Upload button to flash program the device

	![notext](https://github.com/GrayHatGuy/open-iot-stem/blob/ffa3bece4b30c3b41f0eb4d35138f64f3d5a86ac/img/flash.png)

- The terminal window at the bottom of the screen will update with the Upload results

- The device will automatically start when flash is complete
  
## Verification
*[10 min]*

- Open the serial monitor using the menu title bar **Tools>Serial Monitor** or pressing CTRL+SHIFT+M keys

- The serial monitor will show the sensor information below the code window
